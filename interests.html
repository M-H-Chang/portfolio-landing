            <li>Basketball
              <p>To decompress I always like to play pickup basketball either at the gym or with some friends on the
                weekends. Playing basketball has helped me stay active and enjoy quality time with friends.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Boxing
              <p>I have always hated cardio, but when I tried the sport of boxing which is mainly based off of cardio,
                it introduced to a whole new world of cardiovascular health.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Weightlifting
              <p>Every single day, I go to the gym in the morning in order to start my day. Weightlifting has
                trasnformed my life for the better. Starting at the age of 18, now that I'm 24 and have a broad
                knowledge on health I have learned to appreciate the habbit formed of going to the gym everyday.</p>

              <p>I only have a little knowledge on React but I am very excited to move on with the course of Epicodus in
                order to learn the valuable skill of the Javascript library.</p>

            <li>Javascript
              <p>Out of all the languages that I have researched in order to start my coding journey JS has caught my
                attention the most. Using the knowledge of both backend and frontend technologies I can't wait to
                implement my knowledge on my own projects with JS.</p>

            <li>C#
              <p>Not knowing much about C# I am very excited to start another journey down this route in order to learn

              <p>As my mom is an investor, she has taught me the valuable lesson of learning how to invest and building
                wealth over time. Investing is not just in a financial sense, it can also be of knowledge and in
                yourself.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Budgeting
              <p>Learning about budgeting from such a young age I was able to save enough for whatever emergencies that
                have popped up and I get closer to financial freedom/wellness everyday. I have also implemented in my
                past job in finance in order to help clients reach their financial goals.</p>

            <li>Credit
              <p>Many people don't know about the benefits of their credit score and credit in general. You can do a lot
                of interesting financial decisions with having a good credit score and have a deep knowledge of
                different credit products.</p>
